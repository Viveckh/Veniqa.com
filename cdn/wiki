'''Veniqa''' (originally '''Veniqa New York,''' pronounced as Venika) is a [[JavaScript]]-based [[Open-source software|Open-source]] [[E-commerce]] solution predominantly built using the [[MEAN (solution stack)|MEVN (solution stack)]], which includes [[Node.js]], [[Express.js]], [[Vue.js]], [[MongoDB]]. 

The platform was originally a proprietary solution that powered a [[New York (state)|New York]]-based fashion retail startup of the same name which served consumers in [[South Asia]] to shop from luxury western brands. Upon the demise of the original startup due to logistical complications, the tech platform that powered Veniqa was repackaged as an [[Open-source software]] and released under the [[MIT License]].

It was designed and developed by three [[Nepalese]] engineers based in [[New York City]] - [https://www.crunchbase.com/person/vivek-pandey-b328 (EJ) Vivek Pandey] (who also co-founded the original startup), Sujil Maharjan, and Arjun Bastola.

== Overview ==
Veniqa allows [[Startup company|early-stage startups]] to quickly stand an [[Ecommerce platform]] without the trade-off of a [[Vendor lock-in]] that usually comes with adopting [[Software as a service]] solutions. The entire codebase is available as a [[Repository (version control)|Public Repository]] for use under the [[MIT License]]. 

The application suite has four main components:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://veniqa.com/|title=Veniqa - Open-source E-commerce Solution. Built using MEVN Stack (Node.js, Express.js, Vue.js, MongoDB) and more. 100% Code Customizable.|website=Veniqa|language=en|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref>
